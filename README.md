# Slug-Flow-Crystallization-Dynamic-Model
This project implements a pipeline to cluster and model time-series data from a chemical reactor for forecasting key reactor state variables using deep learning. It includes multiple models, including the currently accepted best model based on test evaluations, a Bidirectional LSTM-based model with multiple heads.
